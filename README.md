# Kareem Zedan

I was 14 when I downloaded my first C++ book. I then got into music and started playing drums, started gigging and touring. Alongside my musician's career I worked in retail, sales and customer service.

Fast forward 12 years I applied for my first coding course at Makers Aacademy. I have to say the experience has been an absolute "Ruby" of a gem!

Coding looks very appealing to me! I love nothing more than finishing a page of code and just staring at the magnifecence of
it's appearance! Not only that, but I love to code! Nothing stimulates my brain more.

As a former sales rep, customer service specialist and catering assistant I have a lot more to offer than just problem solving
skills. I am looking for a software engineering role to progress my skills further.

Tech Skills: Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including ES6), jQuery, Jasmine, PostgreSQL

Behavioural Skills: XP, TDD, Agile, pair programming, whole-team projects, code reviews
