# Kareem Zedan

Software Engineer able to program across the whole stack using TDD. Experienced in different coding languages and frameworks. First-hand experience working in an Agile environment. Experience includes pair programming, working in groups and solo work.

As an ex Drummer and Customer Service specialist, I have a lot more to offer than my problem-solving skills. My career started in Sales which included cold calling while touring Europe with my band as a Drummer. I then moved on to Customer Service and Retail. I decided to change career to become a programmer and graduated from Makers on 13/09/2019.

 I am seeking a role where I can progress my skills further, preferably in a company that facilitates learning and provides growth opportunities.
