# Kareem Zedan

I was 14 when I downloaded my first C++ book. I then got into music and started playing drums, started gigging and touring. Alongside my musician's career I worked in retail, sales and customer service.

Fast forward 12 years I applied for my first coding course at Makers.

I started at Makers barely knowing how to do fizzbuzz in Ruby and graduated having made a VR Pac-Man game in C#.

As a former sales rep, customer service specialist and catering assistant I have a lot more to offer than just problem solving
skills. I am looking for a software engineering role to progress my skills further.

Tech Skills: Ruby, C#, Javascript, Python, Rails, Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara, HTML, CSS, Jasmine, PostgreSQL.

Behavioural Skills: XP, TDD, Agile, pair programming, whole-team projects, code reviews

As a drummer who toured Europe and the UK I practiced 2-3 hours everyday. I am also a fitness junkie and workout every single day, I also practice combat sports & martial arts, which requires high amounts of discipline.

### Problem Solving

While working on my [Bowling Scorecard](https://github.com/KZedan/bowling-challenge) I got stuck quite a few times with it. I worked on it for two weekends till I finally got it to work.
